NAME

    TT2::Play::Area - Simple site to allow playing with TT2 syntax and
    built in plugins.

VERSION

    version 0.001

 DESCRIPTION

    This is a mini site for testing Template Toolkit 2 and Template::Alloy
    rendering in a similar way to sites like jsFiddle. It provides a pane
    for editing the template, and a pane for providing the variables to
    pass it (in JSON).

    The site is automatically built into a docker container on quay.io so
    if you simply want to spin it up the quickest way is to,

        docker run -d -p5000:5000 quay.io/colinnewell/tt2-play-area:latest

    This will expose it on port 5000 on localhost, so you should be able to
    browse to http://localhost:5000.

    Currently supported 'engines' are,

      * Template (TT2)

      * Template::Alloy

      * Template::Alloy (using AUTO_FILTER html)

    On the front end jQuery and CodeMirror are used to provide the UI.
